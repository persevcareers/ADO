#cluster creation
#Parameters and Options:
--resource-group dev-cluster:

Specifies the Azure resource group where the AKS cluster will be created (dev-cluster in this case). A resource group is a logical container for grouping Azure resources.
--name dev-env:

Defines the name of the AKS cluster (dev-env in this case). This will be the name used to identify your AKS cluster within Azure.
--node-count 2:

Specifies the initial number of nodes (virtual machines) in the AKS cluster. Nodes are where your Kubernetes pods (containers) will run. Here, the cluster will start with 2 nodes.
--enable-addons monitoring:

Enables the Kubernetes monitoring add-on for the AKS cluster. This add-on sets up Azure Monitor for containers, which provides monitoring and logging capabilities for your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
--generate-ssh-keys:

Generates SSH public and private key files that you can use to authenticate with the nodes in your AKS cluster. These keys are generated locally and saved to ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub by default.
